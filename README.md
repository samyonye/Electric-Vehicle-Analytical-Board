The data narrates the growth of EV adoption over time, 
highlights dominant manufacturers and models, and reflects how infrastructure and incentives shape consumer behavior.

Introduction
The rapid transition toward sustainable transportation has positioned electric vehicles (EVs) as a critical component of modern mobility systems. 
This technical report analyzes electric vehicle population data to understand adoption trends, market composition, 
geographic distribution, and the influence of policy incentives. 
The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for policymakers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders within the EV ecosystem.

 
 Story of the Data
The dataset captures registered electric vehicles across multiple regions and years. 
It includes information on vehicle make, model, model year, electric vehicle type (BEV or PHEV), geographic location, electric range, 
and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility. 
The data narrates the growth of EV adoption over time, highlights dominant manufacturers and models, 
and reflects how infrastructure and incentives shape consumer behavior.

 
 Data Splitting and Preprocessing
The data was prepared for analysis through the following steps:

Separation of variables into categorical (make, model, EV type, state) and numerical fields (vehicle count, electric range).
Filtering to remove duplicate and incomplete records where necessary.
Grouping data by model year, state, make, and EV type to enable trend and comparative analysis.
Categorization of CAFV eligibility into eligible, not eligible, and unknown.
These steps ensured consistency, accuracy, and suitability for dashboard visualization.
 
Pre-Analysis
Before in-depth analysis, exploratory checks were performed to understand:

The total number of registered electric vehicles.
Distribution of vehicles by EV type.
Basic trends across model years.
Presence of missing or unknown values, especially within CAFV eligibility.
This stage provided context and guided the analytical focus areas.
 
 In-Analysis
During analysis, several key patterns emerged:

EV adoption shows a strong upward trajectory, with rapid growth in recent model years.
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) significantly outnumber Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
The EV market is highly concentrated, with Tesla accounting for the largest share.
Adoption levels vary widely across states, indicating regional disparities.
A substantial portion of vehicles qualifies for CAFV incentives, while some records remain unclassified.
 
 
 Post-Analysis and Insight
The findings suggest that electric vehicle adoption is accelerating due to technological improvements, increased consumer confidence, and supportive policies. 
The dominance of BEVs indicates a clear transition away from hybrid solutions. 
Manufacturer concentration highlights competitive advantages for early innovators, 
while geographic variation emphasizes the role of infrastructure and policy support. 
Data gaps in CAFV eligibility point to limitations in reporting and tracking mechanisms.

Recommendation and Observation
Observations

EV adoption is increasing rapidly.
BEVs dominate the market.
Adoption is higher in infrastructure-rich states.
Government incentives significantly influence EV uptake.

Recommendations

Expand charging infrastructure in low-adoption regions.
Strengthen and standardize incentive programs.
Improve data collection to reduce unknown classifications.
Encourage market competition through innovation and affordability.
Support utility readiness for increased electricity demand.
 
Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that the electric vehicle industry is experiencing sustained growth driven by policy support, technological advancements, 
and consumer acceptance. While progress is evident, long-term success depends on infrastructure expansion, improved data quality, 
and broader participation across regions and manufacturers. 
Continuous data monitoring through dashboards will be essential for guiding future decisions.
